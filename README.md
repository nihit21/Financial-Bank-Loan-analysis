# Financial-Bank-Loan-analysis
## Project Overview
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of bank loan data using SQL and Tableau to derive actionable insights and enhance decision-making processes within the financial institution. Leveraging SQL queries, I extracted and transformed relevant data pertaining to loan applications, total Payment, total loan amount, interest rates, and borrower demographics from the bank's databases. Through meticulous data cleaning and preprocessing, I ensured data integrity and consistency for subsequent analysis.

Using Tableau, I visualized key metrics such as % of god loan vs % bad loan, average loan amounts, Purpose of the loan and borrower profiles to provide stakeholders with intuitive and interactive dashboards. These visualizations facilitated deeper understanding of trends, patterns, and risk factors associated with the bank's loan portfolio.
By combining SQL data querying with Tableau visualization capabilities, this project demonstrates my proficiency in leveraging data analytics tools to drive informed decision-making and strategic initiatives within the financial sector.

## There are 3 dashboards which are:
### Summary Dashboard - Provides summary of the overall insights from the data.

## Dataset
For this analysis, we utilized a fictitious dataset of a bank. The dataset contains various attributes, such as Id , Loan Amount , Amount Received, Purpose of Loan, Own a house, region etc.
The first phase of the project involved performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset by the use of SQL. During EDA, data was examined, checked for missing values, and gained initial insights into the data distribution. EDA provided crucial insights that laid the foundation for further analysis. In the second phase of the project, we focused on analyzing Loan applications based on different criteria within the dataset. The final phase of the project involved leveraging the power of Tableauto create interactive data visualizations and a comprehensive report. 

## Acknowledgements
I would like to express my gratitude to Data Tutorials for providing the case study and dataset for this project. Their contribution made this analysis possible and helped me gain valuable insights into Bank Loan Analysis.

I hope you find the insights valuable and applicable to your business scenarios. Happy analyzing!
